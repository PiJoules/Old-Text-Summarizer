Who doesn’t love making money while doing little to no actual work? The answer is, “No one.” However, some ways of making quick money are demonstrably more pleasant than others, as demonstrated by Airpnp, a new mobile app that lets you rent out your bathroom for complete strangers to use when they have to go in your neighborhood. The app acts as a sort of Craigslist for bathrooms that lets you advertise that your bathroom can be used and also sets your price at anywhere from $0 for less-than-appealing bathrooms to $10 for bathrooms that deliver the luxury treatment.

But that’s not the best part. No, the best part is that your very temporary tenants will then have the opportunity to rate your bathroom on Airpnp’s webpage. One $1 bathroom in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for instance, has drawn strong reviews from early adopters, with one user saying that they “loved to take a dump here” and another one exclaiming that it hosted their “best pee ever!!!!!!”

So anyone out there who has a bathroom and wants to make some easy money can now snap some pics of their lavatory and watch the cash roll in… provided you don’t mind having people in your house who are eager to tell the world that they “loved to take a dump here.”

For the time being Airpnp is just a mobile-optimized web app although dedicated native versions for iOS and Android are apparently in the works.
